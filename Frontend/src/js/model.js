She has good communication skills (just talks about things pertaining to work, doesn’t like to gossip, what a bore!) and takes full responsibility for her work (because her brain is hardwired that way). She is an avid reader (wastes her free time reading books). Gets excited about new projects and believes in continuous learning (Told ya! It's one strange human…)`,
